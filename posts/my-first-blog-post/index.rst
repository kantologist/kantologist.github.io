After much speculation, I eventually decided to have a blog post. I hope to be able to use this as: 
* catalogue of my ideas
* A window for engaging the people in argumentative and interesting topics in various fields of studies
* an avenue of teaching stuffs I have learnt that I think others could benefit from.
  - I hope to achieve this by the use of jupyter notebook for python tutorials
  - a link to other stuffs should be available as a project navigation item (working on it)
*etc 

I believe this would be an interesting experience for me and for potential friends.
