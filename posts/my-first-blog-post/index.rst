After much speculation, I eventually decided to have a blog post. I hope to be able to use this as

1. catalogue of my ideas

2. A window for engaging the people in argumentative and interesting topics in various fields of studies

3. an avenue of teaching stuffs I have learnt that I think others could benefit from.

  i. I hope to achieve this by the use of jupyter notebook for python tutorials

  ii. a link to other stuffs should be available as a project navigation item (working on it)

4. etc 

I believe this would be an interesting experience for me and my potential friends.
